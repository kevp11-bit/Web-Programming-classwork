# Web-Programming-classwork

 

	Hello professor, my name is Kevin Portillo, and I am in my senior year. As mentioned in class on the first day, I am pursuing my second bachelor's degree in computer science. My first degree was in Marketing, which I obtained in 2013. My experience with computers started about four years ago, when I pursued my associate’s degree in cyber security at Orange County Community College. My favorite courses were Computer Forensics and Intro to Python. After taking the python course I knew I wanted to pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science and a career as well. I haven’t worked on any projects as I work full time and work a part time job during the summer as I pay for school out of pocket.
	I was hoping to learn a new skill while taking your course as I would like to make myself indispensable to any company that may hire me in the future. In class you mentioned you would do just about anything to help anyone in your class, so there is nothing I ask of you. The only thing I need to do is not be stubborn and ask for help, before I fall behind in class.
